# Big Data Project 1
_WPI Graduate Course: DS503 - Big Data Management_

In this project, I wrote map-reduce jobs in Java language and Apache Pig scripts, then ran them on the Hadoop system.

I performed four activities in this project: 

1. Created datasets
2. Uploaded the datasets into Hadoop HDFS
3. Queried the data by writing map-reduce Java code
4. Queried the data using Pig scripts

For more details on the project implementation, please see the _Readme.pdf_
